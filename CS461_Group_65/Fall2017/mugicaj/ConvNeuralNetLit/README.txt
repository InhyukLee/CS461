The following links are what i have been utilizing to familiarize myself with conv neural nets. Much to my dismay most of the openCV
neural net capabilities that i have been working on do not neccessarily apply. I am still furthering my understanding of openCV since 
documentation is very limited but the resources i provide here should give you guys a good enough understanding so that when the code is
posted it makes sense as to what is going on.

I searched many more but found these to be the most suitable. Some browsing of your own might also help. If chris asks where we are at on 
the implementation i think its best to say we assumed functions on OpenCV that are not there and are doing research on those 
implematations.

Code examples are very specific to themselves so i didn;t really see muhc point in posting them. As i spend the next hours flying in i will
be compiling my own examples.
