Oregon State University CS Capstone 2017 - 2018
Group 65
Project: 'SigFind'
Client: CDK Global
Team: Geddings, Lee, Mugica

Overview:

The goal of this project is the creation of an open-source program capable of interpreting forms and documents to determine whether they posess a signature line and if said signature line is sufficiently marked to constitute as a binding signature.

The breakdown of this repo consists of a documentations and project portion. Under documentation we have several group effort reports and writeups and under personal some individual research and points of interest. These documents function as our guideline for how we intend to implement the program and what options we have considered.

Under the project section we have the bulk all of our coding stored. An important note is the use of both OCR Tesseract AND OpenCV for image processing. In addition, the merging of the two seperate designs into a single program is also stored here. As progress continues on it's development additional versions of the program will be posted.
