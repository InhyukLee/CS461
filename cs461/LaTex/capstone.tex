        	This document writes about the brief description of the CDK Data Stream A.I. project, possible problems, and possible solutions. The main goal of the CDK Data Stream A.I. project is making artificial intelligence that evaluate CDK data stream. By evaluating it, A.I must provide possible solution to Global CDK$’$s potential customers. The main problem of this project is the vagueness of the project description. To address this problem, our group needs to meet our client in person, and get detail information about the project.

\section{Project abstract:}
Estimated goal of CDK Data Stream A.I. is to construct an A.I. system that evaluates stream of customer$’$s information to provide possible solution for client. Global CDK company provides possible technology and digital marketing solution to automobile retail industry; therefor, streams of data could be the personal information of current and potential customer. A.I. should be able to predict the customer$'$s preference, so system could help clients to make better judgement. 

\section{Problems:}
Our group did not had chance to meet our client in person last week, so our group does not know what exactly client wants. On the description of the project on class website, it is written that client wants to build an A.I that improve their customers$’$ experience by using their data stream. This description does not mention what data stream is and what specific A.I that client wants to build. 

\section{Proposed solution:}
To address the problem, our group needs to meet our client in person to ask more details about our project. Meeting is set on 10/9/17 at 9 am. To make our meeting effective, our group needs to make a list of question to ask, and research about the Global CDK company, data stream, and Amazon web service.
