Overview:

Several individual written reports are required by the course to satisfy the WIC requirements. These three subsequent directories store our individual reports for the problem statement and technical review document. Our problem statements provided a general overview of how we initially interpreted the challenge posed by our client. In addition, we attempted to gauge what form of grading metrics would be required to indicate whether we passed or failed at meeting the target goal. The technical review changes gears in that each member has a distinctly different report. We divided the workload to determine what three elements can be explored per member for developing the program. Below is a listing of the sections we researched per tech review:

Lee: 
	Deep Learning Libraries
	Text Recognition Software
	User Interface
Geddings: 
	OpenCV Language
	Filter Algorithm
	File Conversions

Mugica:
	Neural Network Algorithm
	Container Software
	Development Platform
