Abstract:
Our team has been assigned to assist in the development of AI for application to CDKâ€™s existing Data Streams. These streams deal mainly with the classification of documents as well as pictures and information contained within them. This document outlines the various requirements our team has been tasked with fulfilling, as well constraints, time frames, platforms and strategies utilized for their completion. These requirements range from basic functionality pertaining to signature detection, to stretch goals such as license plate reading, car damage detection, and permit and license classification.
