Note:
Please refer to the EDITED_Design_doc directory, this is the most current variant of our design document.
Overview:
This document builds upon the ideas and work shown in the previously done technology review under our personal documentation directories and expands upon them. This includes all seperate components the group did research on then adds a 'perspective' to each category to showcase our thought process and conclusion on a given piece.
Abstract:
The purpose of the design document is to outline the various pieces we’ve previously covered in our technology reviews and add a projection of what our plans are regarding the decided upon technology for each piece. Given our research centric project, we will be taking care to mention potential alternatives should a decided upon technology prove ineffective at accomplishing our goals. Each piece of technology discussed will be done so under a general design viewpoint within which it fits.
